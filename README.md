# DERMASCAN
This project implements a deep learningâ€“based solution for the multi-class classification of 19 skin diseases, including both benign and malignant conditions. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model supports automated dermatological diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings.
